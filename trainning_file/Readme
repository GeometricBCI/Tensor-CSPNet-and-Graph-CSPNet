This is the training file (.py and .ipynb) for both methods on two secnarios and datasets. 

I have tested several runs using .ipynb files with the given network and training parameters and strategies. The results looks very closed to the reported ones. 
Please try a slightly modified hyperparameters to adapt your device if you cannot reproduce them.
