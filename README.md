# Tensor-CSPNet-and-Graph-CSPNet
In these works, I propose two motor imagery-electroencephalography classifier using geometric deep learning on symmetric positive definite manifolds. Thanks for geometers' great contributions in modern geometry and engineering disciplins.  


Introduction
------------
This is the python implementation of Tensor-CSPNet and Graph-CSPNet.

1. Tensor-CSPNet: Tensor-CSPNet is the first geometric deep learning approach for the motor imagery-electroencephalography classification. It exploits the patterns from the time, spatial, and frequency domains sequentially.

2. Graph-CSPNet: Graph-CSPNet uses graph-based techniques to simultaneously characterize the EEG signals in both the time and frequency domains. It exploits the time-frequency domain simultaneously, and then in the space domain.
