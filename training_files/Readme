This is the training file (.py file) for both methods on two scenarios and datasets. 

I have tested several runs with the given network and training parameters and strategies. The results look very close to the reported ones. 
Please try slightly modified hyperparameters to adapt your device if you cannot reproduce them.

There are several training strategies probably helpful to follow:
1. Set the learning rate = 1e-3.
2. Pick a small batch size. I prefer to let the number equal the size of the testing trials.
3. The epoch of each run should be over 50. So, don't use the early stopping in some scenarios.
...

Keep in mind that the reported results are the best that we achieve, rather than an average of many runs'.
